## Deciding the category and location to open a new restaurant in downtown area,Shanghai

Shanghai, one of the four direct-controlled municipalities in China, has always been described as the "showpiece" of the booming economy only after the United States. As the financial and economic hub of China, Shanghai is a great place offering plenty of opportunities for people who want to succeed and thrive. On the other hand, greater opportunities come with fiercer competitions as starting a new business in Shanghai always means having hundreds and thousands of potential rivals from around the country and the world beyond. Therefore, it is of vital importance to be well-informed and better prepared before large financial resources are pulled in. This is especially true for people thinking of openning a new restaurant in the downtown area of Shanghai as there are just so many different restaurants catering to the various appetites of people working or living in the city center, most of whom could be white collar workers, foreigners and residents who are more likely to be middle-class or above. 

This project, through data analysis, tries to provide insights for decision makers by answering the following questions:

* What kind of restaurant should l open?
* Where should my restaurant be located to ensure better profitability?
